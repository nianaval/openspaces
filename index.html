  Open Spaces Boston

  An interactive map and guide of the various open spaces—parks, fields, reservations, gardens, plazas, and even cemeteries—in Boston, MA. The website features filters for the different types of spaces a Bostonian may be looking for, as well as details on any space that is clicked.

  This was a final project for a Programming Basics class I took at Northeastern University in the fall of 2017, and includes the use of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Google Maps Javascript API. I have since improved the website with Boostrap.
